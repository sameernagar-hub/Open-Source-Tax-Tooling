# Synthetic Freelancer hledger Adapter

## Status

Phase 19 safety and failure handling is complete. The CLI can load committed configuration, validate the canonical synthetic fixtures, discover and version-probe hledger, run real read-only `print -O json`, `balance --flat -O json`, and `incomestatement --depth 3 -O json` reports through scratch copies, reconcile the results, emit normalized transactions/account balances/controlled Schedule C-style totals/tax-adjacent facts, and run a stable failure matrix for expected bad inputs and hledger discovery failures.

Demo packaging, a Vercel-ready project dashboard UI, and optional Markdown output are still planned for later phases.

The implementation contract is in [`design.md`](design.md). The selected target and comparison rationale are in [`research/prototype_target_decision.md`](../research/prototype_target_decision.md).

## What This Prototype Will Prove

The prototype will drive a real hledger executable through its local CSV, CLI, and JSON surfaces. It will turn controlled synthetic freelancer transactions into reconciled, normalized bookkeeping and tax-adjacent facts that another program or AI agent can consume.

The planned flow is:

```text
synthetic CSV + strict category map + optional mileage context
  -> wrapper preflight
  -> isolated read-only hledger reports
  -> JSON reconciliation
  -> normalized JSON
  -> optional Markdown view
```

The adapter will:

- Validate dates, exact decimal amounts, amount direction, source IDs, accounts, categories, tax-hint pairs, and synthetic context before hledger runs.
- Reject duplicate IDs and unknown categories that hledger itself accepted during the Day 9 evaluation.
- Run only read-only hledger `print`, `balance`, and `incomestatement` reports.
- Return normalized transactions, accounts, checking balance, controlled Schedule C-style bookkeeping totals, interest, charity, estimated-payment tracking, mileage status, warnings, limitations, and provenance.
- Preserve mileage without choosing a rate or calculating a deduction.

It will not:

- Support real taxpayer or financial data. Real data is prohibited by project policy, although the adapter cannot reliably detect a user violating that policy.
- Prepare, calculate, validate, or file a tax return.
- Decide whether an expense or donation is deductible.
- Generate Form 1040, schedules, a refund estimate, PDF forms, MeF XML, or e-file output.
- Mutate a user ledger, start a server, use the network, or auto-install hledger.

## Runtime and Interface

The implementation uses Python 3.11+ with no third-party runtime dependencies. hledger remains a separate prerequisite. The package lives directly under `prototype/hledger_adapter/`, so the examples run from `prototype/` without installation; this is why fixture paths begin with `../evidence/`.

Implemented CLI commands through Day 18:

```text
python -m hledger_adapter validate --transactions ../evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_transactions.csv --context ../evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_tax_profile.json --confirm-synthetic
python -m hledger_adapter summarize --transactions ../evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_transactions.csv --context ../evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_tax_profile.json --hledger-bin /path/to/hledger --confirm-synthetic
python -m hledger_adapter summarize --transactions ../evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_transactions.csv --context ../evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_tax_profile.json --hledger-bin /path/to/hledger --dry-run --confirm-synthetic
python -m hledger_adapter smoke --hledger-bin /path/to/hledger
python -m hledger_adapter demo --hledger-bin /path/to/hledger
```

The `demo` command selects the repository's canonical synthetic inputs automatically.

Implemented safety check through Day 19:

```text
python tests/run_failure_matrix.py
```

### Commands

| Command | Purpose | Calls hledger? | Persists state by default? |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `validate` | Validate input, map, and optional context. | no | no |
| `summarize --dry-run` | Validate, resolve hledger, and show the planned full-report execution. | no | no |
| `smoke` | Run read-only transaction/account reconciliation for supplied synthetic inputs. | yes | no |
| `demo` | Run the end-to-end summary against fixed canonical fixtures. | yes | no |
| `summarize` | Run the end-to-end summary for supplied synthetic inputs. | yes | no |

## Inputs

| Input | Role |
|---|---|
| [`synthetic_freelancer_transactions.csv`](../evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_transactions.csv) | Canonical 19-row synthetic transaction fixture. |
| [`synthetic_freelancer_tax_profile.json`](../evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_tax_profile.json) | Optional context. Version 1 reads identity/privacy fields and mileage quantity only, requires mileage rate/deduction to remain null, and never uses stored financial totals as calculation inputs. |
| [`config/category_map.json`](config/category_map.json) | Exact account, category, tax-hint, sign, and summary-bucket allowlist. |
| [`config/hledger.csv.rules`](config/hledger.csv.rules) | Static adapter-owned CSV conversion rules based on the tested Day 9 rules. |

The transaction header is fixed:

```text
transaction_id,date,payee,description,account,category,tax_hint,amount_usd,cleared,memo
```

Version 1 is intentionally limited to one 2025 USD dataset, `Assets:Checking` as the source account, exact known categories, and cleared synthetic transactions. A second valid CSV may be supplied for the non-mutating `TADD` scenario.

The category map is adapter-owned and immutable in version 1; the CLI does not accept a replacement mapping file. Dry-run mode rejects kept-scratch usage and fails clearly if no hledger executable candidate can be found. Output-file and Markdown-file options are still later-phase work.

## Output

Day 18 commands emit structured JSON for validation, dry-run plans, transaction/account reconciliation, and the executed summary. The verified baseline result reports hledger version `1.52.1`, 19 transactions, 38 postings, 14 accounts, checking balance `8964.77`, and passed reconciliation checks. The baseline plus `TADD` run reports 20 transactions, 40 postings, 14 accounts, checking balance `8939.78`, software cash expenses `263.99`, Schedule C-style cash expenses before mileage `1167.97`, and Schedule C-style net before mileage `9082.03`.

The canonical summary output is versioned JSON. Money is emitted as exact two-decimal strings, not binary floating-point numbers. Raw hledger paths, source positions, indexes, and machine-specific fields are removed.

The baseline demo must produce:

| Measure | Expected value |
|---|---:|
| Transactions | 19 |
| Accounts | 14 |
| Opening checking balance | `1200.00` |
| Ending checking balance | `8964.77` |
| Bookkeeping income-statement revenue | `10327.75` |
| Bookkeeping income-statement expenses | `1512.98` |
| Bookkeeping income-statement net | `8814.77` |
| Schedule C-style gross receipts | `10250.00` |
| Schedule C-style cash expenses before mileage | `1142.98` |
| Schedule C-style net before mileage | `9107.02` |
| Interest income | `77.75` |
| Cash charitable contributions | `370.00` |
| Federal estimated payments tracked | `1050.00` |
| Business miles preserved, not monetized | `78.2` |

hledger's overall income-statement net is not the Schedule C-style result because it also includes interest and charity. The adapter will aggregate only explicitly mapped postings for the Schedule C-style section.

An optional Markdown view may be added after the JSON contract is stable. It will render the normalized JSON and perform no separate calculations.

## Safety Defaults

- Synthetic data only. Custom runs require `--confirm-synthetic`; this is an acknowledgement, not a PII detector.
- Input files are read-only, hashed, validated, and copied into a fresh temporary directory.
- hledger receives only scratch copies and static adapter rules.
- Subprocesses use argument arrays with no shell interpolation.
- Only read-only report commands are permitted.
- Scratch is deleted on success and failure unless `--keep-scratch` is explicit.
- Kept scratch is confined to planned git-ignored storage under `prototype/.scratch/`.
- Output currently goes to standard output.
- Future output-file support must write only new files and never overwrite existing files.
- No user journal, network service, credential, or secret is involved.
- Host-absolute paths are redacted from results and errors.

## Failure Matrix

The Day 19 failure matrix is a standard-library script at [`tests/run_failure_matrix.py`](tests/run_failure_matrix.py). It generates temporary synthetic bad inputs and checks expected structured failures without requiring hledger for preflight cases.

Verified cases:

- Valid fixture validation succeeds.
- Missing synthetic acknowledgement returns `SYNTHETIC_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`.
- Malformed dates return `INPUT_DATE_INVALID`.
- Invalid amounts return `INPUT_AMOUNT_INVALID`.
- Unknown categories return `INPUT_CATEGORY_UNKNOWN`.
- Unknown source accounts return `INPUT_ACCOUNT_UNKNOWN`.
- Duplicate transaction IDs return `INPUT_ID_DUPLICATE`.
- Missing transaction files return `INPUT_NOT_FOUND`.
- Tax-hint mismatches return `INPUT_TAX_HINT_MISMATCH`.
- Wrong amount signs return `INPUT_SIGN_INVALID`.
- Context dataset and mileage failures return `CONTEXT_INVALID`.
- Dry-run plus kept scratch returns `DRY_RUN_OPTION_CONFLICT`.
- Missing hledger returns `HLEDGER_NOT_FOUND`.
- Unusable explicit hledger candidates return `HLEDGER_UNUSABLE`.
- The matrix confirms scratch state is unchanged.

## hledger Setup Boundary

The adapter will look for hledger in this order:

1. `--hledger-bin PATH`
2. `HLEDGER_BIN`
3. `hledger` or `hledger.exe` on `PATH`

It will run `--version` before reports and record the detected version. The project tested hledger 1.52.1 during Day 9; other versions will be labeled untested and must still pass output-shape and reconciliation checks.

No executable is committed, auto-downloaded, or installed by this project. See [`tool_records/tool_1.md`](../tool_records/tool_1.md) and the [Day 9 workflow evidence](../evidence/commands/07-08-2026_hledger_workflow.txt) for the evaluated setup and behavior.

## Limitations and Licensing

The labels `Schedule C-style`, `Schedule A`, and `Schedule B` describe controlled synthetic bookkeeping groupings. They are not authoritative tax treatment.

The repository's prototype code is covered by the repository's MIT license. hledger is a separate GPL-3.0-or-later program and is not bundled. Redistributing or embedding hledger, or packaging a combined work, requires a specific license-compliance review; this prototype does not make a legal conclusion.

## Next Build Slice

Phase 20 will:

- Add a one-command demo wrapper and expected-output sample.
- Create a lightweight Vercel-ready project dashboard UI under the prototype workspace.
- Generate or load a read-only project manifest covering the changelog, notes, evidence, prototype files/output, report/deck state, research files, tool records, and README files.
- Show adapter workflow status, recent verification results, and failure-matrix outcomes in the dashboard without exposing private paths, secrets, or real data.
- Keep the dashboard local-first now and deployable later on Vercel.

Markdown rendering and final clean-checkout verification follow in Phase 21 as defined in [`design.md`](design.md).
