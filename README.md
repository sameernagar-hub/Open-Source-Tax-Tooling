# AI Engineering Internship: Open-Source Tax Tooling Research

This repository tracks a July 2026 AI engineering internship project on open-source consumer tax tooling, bookkeeping systems, and programmatic integration surfaces.

## Research Question

What does the current open-source ecosystem for consumer tax bookkeeping and US tax-return preparation/submission look like, and how feasible is it to connect representative tools to other software through APIs, CLIs, file formats, libraries, schemas, or comparable programmatic surfaces?

## Project Deliverables

- A written research report covering the open-source tax-tooling landscape, per-tool findings, cross-tool comparison, and integration recommendations.
- A small prototype integration using synthetic data only.
- A 20-30 minute presentation deck for mentor review or portfolio use.

## Scope

The project centers on consumer and freelancer-oriented tax/bookkeeping workflows, especially US workflows where practical. Non-US tools may be included as comparators when they show useful API, schema, or automation patterns.

The work will use only generated synthetic data. No real taxpayer data, real financial account data, personally identifiable information, secrets, or live filing credentials belong in this repository.

## Planned Evaluation Areas

Each tool will be evaluated for:

- Identity, license, repository, release activity, and project health.
- Programmatic surface: CLI, library, REST API, plugin system, file format, schema, or database.
- Time to first useful operation from a fresh setup.
- Structured input/output quality and code drivability.
- Bookkeeping, reporting, tax-line mapping, form generation, and filing/submission coverage.
- Safety features such as dry runs, validation, sandboxing, and clear failure behavior.
- Integration fit for a thin wrapper, automation layer, or AI-agent-consumable workflow.

## Current Planning Documents

- [`codex_execution_plan_ai_tax_tooling.md`](codex_execution_plan_ai_tax_tooling.md) defines the month-long execution plan, deliverables, evaluation rubric, risks, and decision gates.
- [`day_by_day_ai_tax_tooling_phases.md`](day_by_day_ai_tax_tooling_phases.md) breaks the internship into daily phases from 07-01-2026 through 07-31-2026.
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) records what changed, why it changed, supporting files, and the next step after each meaningful work session.
- [`notes/internship_brief_alignment.md`](notes/internship_brief_alignment.md) tracks alignment between the attached internship brief and the repository plan.

## Initial Candidate Tools

Starter candidates include:

- GnuCash
- Beancount
- Ledger CLI
- HLedger
- Firefly III
- OpenTaxSolver
- IRS Direct File posture for third parties
- OFX/QIF parsers and CSV-to-ledger tooling
- Selected non-US comparators when useful for API or schema comparison

## Timeline

- Week 1: Landscape survey, workspace setup, longlist, metadata, programmatic-surface review, and shortlist.
- Week 2: Hands-on evaluation with synthetic data and repeatable evidence capture.
- Week 3: Prototype integration around one selected tool.
- Week 4: Final report, presentation deck, publication cleanup, and delivery.

## Repository Status

Phase 30 completed final QA and rehearsal early at user request. The current deliverable set includes `report/full_report_draft.md`, the frozen synthetic hledger prototype, the execution lab, `deck/open_source_tax_tooling_draft_deck.pptx`, and the final QA checklist at `notes/day_30_final_qa_rehearsal.md`.

The frozen prototype includes the repo-root `run_day20_demo.py` wrapper, `prototype/run_day20_demo.py`, a generated repo-relative manifest, a Next.js execution lab under `prototype/execution_lab/`, local live-run API behavior for configured hledger environments, verified replay for deployed/static review, clickable lifecycle phase popups with commands/output, a prototype architecture tab, evidence drawers, artifact inventory, changelog/details tabs, safety results, and `prototype/retrospective.md`.

The current local environment has hledger `1.52.1` installed through Winget, so `python run_day20_demo.py --json` and the execution lab's `/api/run` backend can execute the live synthetic pipeline. Reviewers can still supply `--hledger-bin` or `HLEDGER_BIN`; without any local hledger install, the failure matrix and verified replay path remain runnable.
