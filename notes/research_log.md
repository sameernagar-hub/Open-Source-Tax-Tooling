```

## 07-02-2026 - Phase 2: Workspace and Evidence System

### Goal

Create the research workspace so future findings, command output, source links, and tool evaluations have consistent homes.

### What I Did

- Created the main workspace folders and trackable README files.
- Added evidence subfolders for commands, repository metadata, documentation notes, screenshots, and synthetic fixtures.
- Created `tool_records/template.md`.
- Created `notes/source_citation_conventions.md`.
- Wrote the Day 2 exit note at `notes/day_02_workspace_and_evidence.md`.

### Evidence Captured

- `tool_records/template.md`
- `notes/source_citation_conventions.md`
- `notes/day_02_workspace_and_evidence.md`
- `evidence/README.md`

### Decisions Made

- Use a dedicated citation convention with compact source IDs.
- Store local command and metadata evidence in purpose-specific evidence folders.
- Keep future tool evaluations in one template-driven file per tool.

### Problems / Open Questions

- None for this phase.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Create `research/longlist.md` for the starter candidate tools.

## 07-03-2026 - Maintenance: Changelog and Brief Alignment

### Goal

Create a persistent changelog and compare the repository plan against the attached internship brief.

### What I Did

- Extracted text from `C:\Users\nagar\Downloads\intern_project_description.pdf` with `pypdf`.
- Searched the execution plan, day-by-day plan, README, day notes, research log, and tool template for brief-specific requirements.
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` and backfilled Day 1 and Day 2 entries.
- Created `notes/internship_brief_alignment.md`.
- Updated the execution plan, day-by-day plan, README, and tool-record template with missing or implicit brief details.

### Evidence Captured

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `notes/internship_brief_alignment.md`
- `codex_execution_plan_ai_tax_tooling.md`
- `day_by_day_ai_tax_tooling_phases.md`
- `tool_records/template.md`

### Decisions Made

- Keep the attached PDF out of the repository by default.
- Track third-party wrappers, exact tax-form coverage prompts, stated non-goals, annual tax-year support, and mentorship/logistics terms explicitly.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` after every meaningful work session going forward.

### Problems / Open Questions

- `pdfinfo` was not installed, so PDF inspection used Python and `pypdf`.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Phase 3 by creating `research/longlist.md` for the starter candidate tools.

## 07-04-2026 - Phase 3: Starter Tool Inventory

### Goal

Turn the starter candidate list into a structured longlist with first-pass metadata, docs links, release/status notes, licenses, categories, integration surfaces, and immediately visible wrappers or adjacent tools.

### What I Did

- Created `research/longlist.md` as the Day 3 exit artifact.
- Checked primary project, documentation, release, license, PyPI, and official government pages for the starter candidates.
- Captured first-pass entries for GnuCash, Beancount, Ledger CLI, hledger, Firefly III, OpenTaxSolver, IRS Direct File posture, OFX/QIF parser tooling, and CSV-to-ledger tooling.
- Added immediate adjacent prior art including piecash, beangulp, smart_importer, beancount-import, ledger-autosync, Firefly III Data Importer, and OpenFile.

### Evidence Captured

- `research/longlist.md`
- Source links and compact citation IDs inside `research/longlist.md`
- Primary source families checked: GitHub repositories/releases, PyPI package pages, official documentation sites, SourceForge project/download pages, and IRS Direct File pages.

### Decisions Made

- Treat IRS Direct File as reference architecture and schema/API prior art, not as an active filing candidate.
- Treat OFX/QIF and CSV-to-ledger tooling as adjacent import infrastructure rather than standalone tax or bookkeeping candidates.
- Keep both API-first and plain-text/CLI-first paths alive until the Day 7 shortlist decision.

### Problems / Open Questions

- OpenTaxSolver appears tax-form-relevant but may not expose a clean programmatic API.
- GnuCash Python bindings are optional/build-dependent and need local verification before being considered easy to automate.
- ledger-autosync has newer PyPI metadata than its GitHub latest-release page, so package/release metadata needs reconciliation during the health snapshot.
- OpenFile may deserve promotion to the longlist during Day 4 discovery because it is an active-looking fork of IRS Direct File, but accuracy and status caveats are prominent.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 4 discovery search: expand the longlist with credible additional tools and create `research/exclusions.md` for closed-source, abandoned, irrelevant, or non-consumer candidates.

## 07-05-2026 - Phase 4: Discovery Search

### Goal

Find credible open-source tools not listed in the original brief, expand the longlist, and document exclusions.

### What I Did

- Searched for open-source US tax calculators, 1040/form generators, tax-benefit rules engines, withholding estimators, personal-finance apps, plain-text-accounting interfaces, and import/export tooling.
- Checked primary sources including GitHub repositories, official docs, IRS repositories/pages, PyPI pages, SourceForge pages, and project websites.
- Expanded `research/longlist.md` with newly discovered candidates and prior-art tools.
- Created `research/exclusions.md` for tools excluded because of license, scope, health, maturity, narrowness, or lack of public inspectability.
- Wrote the Day 4 exit note at `notes/day_04_discovery_search.md`.

### Evidence Captured

- `research/longlist.md`
- `research/exclusions.md`
- `notes/day_04_discovery_search.md`
- Source links and citation IDs embedded in the longlist and exclusions file.

### Decisions Made

- Promote UsTaxes, HabuTax, Filed Open Tax Engine, Tax-Calculator, PolicyEngine US, IRS Tax Withholding Estimator, tenforty, and OpenFile as tax-specific or tax-model candidates.
- Promote Actual Budget, KMyMoney, HomeBank, Money Manager Ex, Fava, Paisa, and ofxstatement as personal-finance, UI, or import-layer comparators.
- Treat OpenFile as a cautionary Direct File fork, not as an active filing-channel candidate.
- Treat Tax-Calculator and PolicyEngine US as programmatic tax-model comparators rather than consumer filing tools.
- Exclude or defer Akaunting, ERPNext, Maybe Finance, OpenTaxForms, Python-Taxes, TaxStuff, Kresus, ezBookkeeping, Skrooge, NBER TAXSIM, IRS Free File Fillable Forms, and closed commercial tax products.

### Problems / Open Questions

- New tax-engine candidates need health and accuracy scrutiny before shortlisting.
- Exact license details for KMyMoney and OpenFile need verification.
- Desktop personal-finance tools may be file-format-only, making them weaker for API-style integration.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 5 by creating `research/project_health_snapshot.md` and normalizing release dates, recent activity, licenses, contributor signals, documentation quality, annual tax-year support, and data-format evidence for plausible candidates.

## 07-05-2026 - Phase 5: Metadata and Health Snapshot

### Goal

Gather comparable project-health evidence before choosing the shortlist.

### What I Did

- Created `research/project_health_snapshot.md` as the Day 5 exit artifact.
- Checked GitHub, PyPI, SourceForge, IRS, and official project documentation sources for health, release, license, docs, tax-year, and data-format evidence.
- Split candidates into core shortlist-pressure targets and supporting/lower-priority comparators.
- Wrote the Day 5 exit note at `notes/day_05_metadata_health_snapshot.md`.

### Evidence Captured

- `research/project_health_snapshot.md`
- `notes/day_05_metadata_health_snapshot.md`
- Source links and compact citation IDs inside the snapshot.

### Decisions Made

- Prioritize hledger, Firefly III, Actual Budget, Beancount, GnuCash, OpenTaxSolver, UsTaxes, tenforty, Tax-Calculator, and PolicyEngine US for Day 6 surface review.
- Treat IRS Direct File, OpenFile, and IRS Tax Withholding Estimator as reference/cautionary entries.
- Treat import tools such as ofxtools, ofxstatement, beangulp, smart_importer, beancount-import, and ledger-autosync as supporting infrastructure.

### Problems / Open Questions

- Some projects publish outside GitHub, so GitHub release metadata alone is not reliable.
- GnuCash automation on Windows needs local verification.
- Filed Open Tax Engine is promising but too new to trust without hands-on validation.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 6 by creating `research/programmatic_surface_survey.md` and comparing documented/inferred automation surfaces across the strongest candidates.

## 07-06-2026 - Phase 6: Programmatic Surface Survey

### Goal

Compare how each plausible candidate can be driven from code before installing anything.

### What I Did

- Created `research/programmatic_surface_survey.md` as the Day 6 exit artifact.
- Checked official documentation, API docs, repositories, source architecture notes, and existing Day 5 evidence for the strongest candidates.
- Classified surfaces by whether they are documented stable, documented but constrained, experimental/new, inferred, reference-only, or unclear.
- Compared structured input/output support across CLI, library, REST API, plugin, file-format, schema, database, and report-export surfaces.

### Evidence Captured

- `research/programmatic_surface_survey.md`
- `notes/day_06_programmatic_surface_survey.md`
- Source links and compact citation IDs embedded in the survey.

### Decisions Made

- Prioritize hledger, Actual Budget, Firefly III, Beancount, tenforty, and Filed Open Tax Engine for the Day 7 shortlist discussion.
- Treat OpenTaxSolver and UsTaxes as important tax-form candidates with weaker external API surfaces.
- Treat GnuCash as a mature desktop comparator requiring local CLI/binding verification.
- Treat Tax-Calculator and PolicyEngine US as policy/rules comparators, not filing products.
- Keep IRS Direct File, OpenFile, and IRS Tax Withholding Estimator as reference-only architecture evidence.

### Problems / Open Questions

- The Day 7 shortlist needs to decide whether both Actual and Firefly are necessary.
- Filed Open Tax Engine needs hands-on accuracy and maturity checks before it can be recommended.
- Beancount v2/v3 tooling differences need verification.
- GnuCash remains promising but likely setup-heavy on Windows.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 7 by creating `research/shortlist.md`, scoring candidates, and selecting 3-5 tools for Week 2 hands-on evaluation.

## 07-07-2026 - Phase 7: Shortlist Decision

### Goal

Choose 3-5 tools for deep Week 2 evaluation and document a defensible selection rationale.

### What I Did

- Created `research/shortlist.md` as the Day 7 exit artifact.
- Scored plausible candidates across relevance, integration surface, project health, tax workflow fit, and demo potential.
- Selected hledger, Actual Budget, Firefly III, tenforty, and Filed Open Tax Engine for Week 2 hands-on evaluation.
- Created `notes/day_07_shortlist_decision.md` as the Day 7 exit note.
- Identified backup candidates and replacement conditions for Beancount, OpenTaxSolver, UsTaxes, and GnuCash.

### Evidence Captured

- `research/shortlist.md`
- `notes/day_07_shortlist_decision.md`
- Prior evidence from `research/longlist.md`, `research/project_health_snapshot.md`, `research/programmatic_surface_survey.md`, and `research/exclusions.md`.

### Decisions Made

- Use hledger for the plain-text accounting slot.
- Use Actual Budget and Firefly III to compare local-first API/CLI integration against REST JSON integration.
- Use tenforty and Filed Open Tax Engine for tax-oriented coverage.
- Keep Beancount as the first plain-text backup and OpenTaxSolver as the first mature tax-form backup.

### Problems / Open Questions

- Filed Open Tax Engine needs skeptical hands-on maturity and accuracy checks.
- Firefly III setup cost may affect Week 2 timing.
- tenforty's OpenTaxSolver dependency path needs local verification.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 8 by creating the synthetic dataset and evaluation checklist for the five shortlisted tools.

## 07-07-2026 - Phase 8: Evaluation Harness and Synthetic Data

### Goal

Prepare shared synthetic fixtures and a repeatable evaluation checklist for the Week 2 hands-on tool evaluations.

### What I Did

- Created `evidence/synthetic_dataset.md` as the Day 8 synthetic dataset artifact.
- Created `evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_transactions.csv` and `evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_tax_profile.json`.
- Created `research/evaluation_checklist.md` with setup, workflow, tax-coverage, failure-testing, evidence, and tool-record checklists.
- Created `notes/day_08_evaluation_harness_and_synthetic_data.md` as the Day 8 exit note.
- Defined expected totals for the baseline dataset and standard add-transaction test.

### Evidence Captured

- `evidence/synthetic_dataset.md`
- `evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_transactions.csv`
- `evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_tax_profile.json`
- `research/evaluation_checklist.md`
- `notes/day_08_evaluation_harness_and_synthetic_data.md`

### Decisions Made

- Use a 2025 single-freelancer scenario with Schedule C-style income and expenses, interest income, charitable contribution placeholders, estimated tax payments, and mileage metadata.
- Keep mileage separate from cash transactions and assign no deduction value.
- Use `TADD` as the standard add-transaction test outside the baseline CSV.
- Start Day 9 with hledger to validate the shared dataset through the fastest likely file/CLI path.

### Problems / Open Questions

- Tax hints remain evaluation labels, not authoritative tax treatment.
- Tax-oriented tools may need manual assumptions when mapping from the bookkeeping fixture to form-like inputs.
- App/API-backed tools may need account/category setup before import.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 9 by evaluating hledger with the shared dataset and filling the first tool record.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 9: Evaluate Tool 1

### Goal

Evaluate hledger as the first Week 2 hands-on tool and refine the shared evaluation method.

### What I Did

- Downloaded the official hledger `1.52.1` Windows release binary to a temporary directory.
- Captured setup and version evidence without performing a global install.
- Added hledger CSV rules, an add-transaction fixture, bad-input fixtures, and JSON export artifacts.
- Ran the shared workflow: load data, add `TADD`, list accounts, compute balance, run report, and export results.
- Ran failure tests for bad date, bad amount, unknown account/category, missing file, and duplicate transaction ID.
- Created `tool_records/tool_1.md` and the Day 9 exit note.

### Evidence Captured

- `tool_records/tool_1.md`
- `notes/day_09_evaluate_hledger.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_hledger_setup.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_hledger_version.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_hledger_workflow.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_hledger_failure-tests.txt`
- hledger-specific fixtures and JSON outputs under `evidence/fixtures/`

### Decisions Made

- Keep hledger as a leading low-risk prototype candidate for a file/CLI/JSON adapter.
- Treat hledger as tax-adjacent bookkeeping, not tax-preparation or filing software.
- Validate duplicate IDs and unknown categories in any future wrapper because hledger accepts them by default.

### Problems / Open Questions

- hledger-web's JSON API remains untested locally.
- hledger JSON output is machine-readable but needs normalization for a clean prototype API.
- GPL-3.0-or-later implications should be reviewed before any redistributed wrapper or hosted service.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 10 by evaluating Actual Budget with the shared synthetic dataset and comparing its local-first API/CLI behavior against hledger.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 10: Evaluate Tool 2

### Goal

Evaluate Actual Budget as the second Week 2 hands-on tool using the shared synthetic freelancer dataset and the same workflow/failure checklist used for hledger.

### What I Did

- Installed `@actual-app/api@26.7.0` and `@actual-app/cli@26.7.0` in a temporary npm directory.
- Created `evidence/fixtures/actual_day10_evaluate.mjs` to drive the official Actual Node API against a scratch local budget.
- Loaded the 19 baseline synthetic transactions, then added standard transaction `TADD`.
- Queried accounts, categories, transactions, and account balance through the API.
- Exported normalized JSON summaries and transaction rows for comparison with hledger.
- Tested malformed date, invalid amount, unknown category, duplicate imported ID through `importTransactions` dry-run and direct `addTransactions`, and missing budget load.
- Created `tool_records/tool_2.md` and the Day 10 exit note.

### Evidence Captured

- `tool_records/tool_2.md`
- `notes/day_10_evaluate_actual.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_actual_setup.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_actual_version.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_actual_workflow.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_actual_failure-tests.txt`
- `evidence/fixtures/actual_day10_evaluate.mjs`
- `evidence/fixtures/actual_day10_summary.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/actual_day10_transactions_after_add.json`

### Decisions Made

- Keep Actual Budget as a strong local-first app/API candidate and possible prototype backup.
- Treat Actual's tax relevance as manual tax-adjacent bookkeeping and reporting, not tax preparation.
- Prefer `importTransactions` when reconciliation and duplicate imported-ID behavior matters.
- Require wrapper-side validation before `addTransactions` because direct adds accepted an unknown category id and duplicate imported ID.

### Problems / Open Questions

- `runImport` logged an unauthorized cloud upload during local evaluation even though the local budget worked.
- Bad-date errors are correct but verbose; a wrapper should normalize them.
- Category paths need wrapper-side reconstruction because Actual stores category groups and leaf names separately.
- Actual has no native Form 1040, schedules, PDF tax form, MeF, or e-file workflow.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 11 by evaluating Firefly III as the REST/API-backed personal-finance comparator.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 11: Evaluate Tool 3

### Goal

Evaluate Firefly III as the third Week 2 hands-on tool and the REST/API-backed personal-finance comparator.

### What I Did

- Started Docker Desktop and ran isolated local `fireflyiii/core:version-6.6.6` plus `mariadb:lts` containers.
- Created a synthetic local Firefly user, Passport personal-access client, and short-lived API tokens without storing tokens in the repository.
- Added `evidence/fixtures/firefly_day11_evaluate.mjs` to drive the Firefly REST API with the shared synthetic freelancer dataset.
- Modeled `T000` as the Firefly account opening balance, created 12 categories, and posted the 18 non-opening baseline rows through `/api/v1/transactions`.
- Added standard transaction `TADD`, queried account balance and insight endpoints, and exported normalized JSON.
- Ran failure tests for malformed date, invalid amount, unknown category, duplicate transaction, and missing input file.
- Created `tool_records/tool_3.md` and the Day 11 exit note.

### Evidence Captured

- `tool_records/tool_3.md`
- `notes/day_11_evaluate_firefly_iii.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_firefly-iii_setup.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_firefly-iii_version.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_firefly-iii_workflow.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_firefly-iii_failure-tests.txt`
- `evidence/fixtures/firefly_day11_evaluate.mjs`
- `evidence/fixtures/firefly_day11_summary.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/firefly_day11_transactions_after_add.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/firefly_day11_failure_results.json`

### Decisions Made

- Keep Firefly III as the strongest REST-first bookkeeping/API comparator.
- Treat Firefly's tax relevance as manual tax-adjacent bookkeeping and reporting, not tax calculation or filing.
- Require wrapper-side allowlists for controlled tax categories because Firefly can auto-create unknown categories.
- Consider Firefly for a REST-focused prototype, but keep hledger as the lower-friction local/file adapter candidate.

### Problems / Open Questions

- Docker/auth setup is heavier than hledger and Actual Budget.
- The first app run failed until `APP_KEY` was corrected to exactly 32 characters.
- No REST transaction dry-run path was found.
- Firefly has no native Form 1040, schedules, PDF tax form, MeF, or e-file workflow.
- AGPL-3.0 implications need review before redistributed or hosted wrapper work.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 12 by evaluating a fourth shortlisted tool or backup candidate, preferably a tax-specific candidate such as `tenforty` to balance the three bookkeeping/API evaluations.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 12: Evaluate Tool 4

### Goal

Evaluate tenforty as the fourth Week 2 hands-on tool and the first direct tax-calculation library candidate.

### What I Did

- Verified current tenforty source/package docs and installed `tenforty==2025.10`.
- Attempted native Windows setup in an isolated Python `3.14.5` venv; install failed while building the native extension and reported missing Microsoft C++ Build Tools.
- Started Docker Desktop and completed the evaluation in a disposable `python:3.12-slim` Linux container.
- Added `evidence/fixtures/tenforty_day12_evaluate.py` to map the shared synthetic tax profile into tenforty calls.
- Mapped Schedule C net before mileage to the runtime `self_employment_income` argument, and mapped interest income to `taxable_interest`.
- Re-ran the profile after the standard `TADD` software expense by reducing Schedule C net income from `9107.02` to `9082.03`.
- Exported normalized JSON summaries, a scenario grid, and failure-test results.
- Created `tool_records/tool_4.md` and the Day 12 exit note.

### Evidence Captured

- `tool_records/tool_4.md`
- `notes/day_12_evaluate_tenforty.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_tenforty_setup.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_tenforty_version.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_tenforty_workflow.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_tenforty_failure-tests.txt`
- `evidence/fixtures/tenforty_day12_evaluate.py`
- `evidence/fixtures/tenforty_day12_summary.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/tenforty_day12_scenario_grid.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/tenforty_day12_failure_results.json`

### Decisions Made

- Keep tenforty as the leading tax-calculation component candidate, not a standalone bookkeeping or filing target.
- Treat the best prototype idea as a two-stage flow: controlled bookkeeping summaries from hledger/Actual/Firefly, then tenforty tax calculations.
- Keep estimated payments, mileage, and charity-under-standard-deduction as explicit unmapped facts unless a later wrapper defines policy.
- Require wrapper-side domain validation and output sanity checks before exposing tenforty results to users.

### Problems / Open Questions

- Native Windows remains a blocker unless using WSL/Docker/Colab or resolving build/runtime issues.
- The visible README argument table omits the runtime `self_employment_income` argument that best matches the synthetic Schedule C net input.
- `federal_effective_tax_rate` appeared inconsistent in SE-tax-only cases; the wrapper recomputation from federal total tax over AGI was about `15.0652%`, while tenforty returned `128678000000000.0`.
- Negative self-employment income was accepted and produced negative AGI, so wrapper validation is needed.
- tenforty does not model transaction import, estimated payments/refunds, PDF forms, or e-file submission.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 13 by evaluating Filed Open Tax Engine as the fifth tax-specific CLI/JSON candidate, or by closing gaps across the four complete records if the comparison already has enough variety.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 13: Evaluate Tool 5

### Goal

Evaluate Filed Open Tax Engine as the fifth shortlisted tool and the form-level CLI/JSON tax-engine candidate.

### What I Did

- Downloaded the official `v2.0.2` Windows x64 binary into `%TEMP%` and verified its SHA-256 hash.
- Captured CLI help, version, node list, node schema inspection, and Schedule C dependency graph evidence.
- Added `evidence/fixtures/filed_opentax_day13_evaluate.mjs` to run the CLI from an isolated temp working directory.
- Mapped the synthetic freelancer profile to `general`, `f1099int`, `f1040es`, and `schedule_c` form entries.
- Modeled `TADD` as an added Schedule C Part V software expense in a second return.
- Captured baseline, after-add, forced Schedule A charity, validation, MeF export, and failure-test outputs.
- Created `tool_records/tool_5.md` and the Day 13 exit note.

### Evidence Captured

- `tool_records/tool_5.md`
- `notes/day_13_evaluate_filed_opentax.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_filed-opentax_setup.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_filed-opentax_version.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_filed-opentax_workflow.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_filed-opentax_failure-tests.txt`
- `evidence/fixtures/filed_opentax_day13_evaluate.mjs`
- `evidence/fixtures/filed_opentax_day13_summary.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/filed_opentax_day13_failure_results.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/filed_opentax_day13_baseline_mef.xml`

### Decisions Made

- Keep Filed Open Tax Engine as the strongest form-level tax-engine candidate but preserve a maturity warning.
- Treat successful `return get` calculation separately from validation-clean or file-ready status.
- Require wrapper-side checks for supported years, date formats, duplicate source forms, local state directory isolation, and validation/export gating.
- Carry AGPL/commercial license implications into prototype target selection.

### Problems / Open Questions

- Validation/export reported many reject-level rules that looked unrelated to the synthetic return.
- A malformed date string was accepted for `taxpayer_dob`.
- Duplicate 1099-INT entries were accepted and double-counted.
- The baseline emitted an `f2441` executor warning even without dependent-care inputs.
- CLI JSON arguments need shell-safe invocation; PowerShell inline JSON was fragile.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 14 by building a comparison matrix across all five evaluated tools and choosing the Week 3 prototype target plus backup.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 14: Prototype Target Selection

### Goal

Build the Week 2 comparison matrix and choose the Week 3 prototype target and backup target.

### What I Did

- Reviewed all five completed tool records.
- Compared hledger, Actual Budget, Firefly III, tenforty, and Filed Open Tax Engine across prototype value, feasibility, safety, and demo clarity.
- Created `research/comparison_matrix.md`.
- Created `research/prototype_target_decision.md`.
- Created `notes/day_14_prototype_target_selection.md`.
- Updated the README repository status.

### Evidence Captured

- `research/comparison_matrix.md`
- `research/prototype_target_decision.md`
- `notes/day_14_prototype_target_selection.md`
- Week 2 tool records under `tool_records/`

### Decisions Made

- Select hledger as the primary Week 3 prototype target.
- Select Actual Budget as the backup target.
- Frame the prototype as a safe bookkeeping-to-tax-summary adapter, not a tax-preparation or filing product.
- Defer tenforty to a possible future tax-calculation component and Filed Open Tax Engine to form-level research/future extension status.
- Keep Firefly III as the report's strongest REST-first comparator rather than the prototype target.

### Problems / Open Questions

- Day 15 needs to decide whether hledger rules are static fixtures, generated from mapping config, or both.
- The prototype needs a clean hledger binary discovery/setup story.
- GPL obligations should be described before distributing or packaging the adapter.

### Tomorrow's Starting Point

Execute Day 15 by creating `prototype/design.md`, defining the hledger adapter schema and guardrails, and updating the prototype README outline.
