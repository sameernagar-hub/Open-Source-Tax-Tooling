# Changelog

This file tracks meaningful project updates so the internship work can be backtracked without rereading every note, plan, and commit.

Update this file after every work session that changes project direction, research artifacts, prototype code, report/deck content, or repository structure.

Each entry should answer:

- What changed?
- Why did it change?
- What evidence or files were added?
- What is next?

## 07-13-2026 - Phase 19: Safety and Failure Handling

### What Changed

- Added `prototype/tests/run_failure_matrix.py`, a dependency-free subprocess matrix for expected validation, context, policy, dry-run, and hledger-discovery failures.
- Verified 15 cases covering malformed dates, invalid amounts, unknown categories/accounts, duplicate IDs, missing files, tax-hint mismatch, wrong signs, context failures, missing acknowledgement, dry-run kept-scratch conflict, missing hledger, and unusable hledger candidates.
- Confirmed the matrix leaves scratch state unchanged and uses `summarize --dry-run` for preflight failures where possible.
- Updated the prototype README safety/failure sections and the root repository status.
- Updated the Day 20 roadmap to include a Vercel-ready project dashboard UI for changelog, notes, evidence, prototype status/output, report/deck state, research, tool records, and README artifacts.

### Why

Day 19 needed to prove the adapter fails clearly and safely, not just produce the happy-path summary. The UI roadmap change also ensures the prototype week includes a deployable project-viewing application rather than ending with only terminal output.

### Evidence / Files

- `prototype/tests/run_failure_matrix.py`
- `prototype/README.md`
- `prototype/design.md`
- `day_by_day_ai_tax_tooling_phases.md`
- `notes/day_19_safety_failure_handling.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-13-2026_hledger-adapter_day19_failures.txt`

### Next

Execute Day 20 by adding a one-command demo and a Vercel-ready project dashboard UI scaffold with a generated read-only artifact manifest.

## 07-13-2026 - Phase 18: Balance and Report Summary

### What Changed

- Extended the hledger runner to execute `incomestatement --depth 3 -O json` alongside `print -O json` and `balance --flat -O json`.
- Added `prototype/hledger_adapter/summary.py` to derive controlled summary buckets from reconciled transactions/accounts and cross-check them against hledger's income statement.
- Implemented executed `summarize` output and upgraded `demo` to the canonical end-to-end fixed-fixture summary.
- Added Schedule C-style gross receipts, cash-expense groupings, net before mileage, interest, charity, federal estimated-payment tracking, preserved mileage facts, warnings, limitations, and provenance.
- Verified the baseline fixture, the baseline plus `TADD` scenario, dry-run behavior, smoke behavior, missing-context mileage handling, and default scratch cleanup.

### Why

Day 18 needed to complete the second half of the demo workflow. The adapter now turns reconciled hledger postings into deterministic, machine-readable bookkeeping and tax-adjacent facts without treating those facts as tax calculations or official tax treatment.

### Evidence / Files

- `prototype/hledger_adapter/hledger.py`
- `prototype/hledger_adapter/models.py`
- `prototype/hledger_adapter/summary.py`
- `prototype/hledger_adapter/cli.py`
- `prototype/README.md`
- `notes/day_18_balance_report_summary.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-13-2026_hledger-adapter_day18_summary.txt`

### Next

Execute Day 19 by adding stable failure checks for malformed dates, invalid amounts, unknown categories/accounts, duplicate IDs, missing files, context failures, missing hledger, and dry-run option conflicts.

## 07-13-2026 - Phase 17: Transaction and Account Reconciliation

### What Changed

- Extended validated CSV loading so each accepted source row is retained as a structured transaction record.
- Added a hledger report runner that executes both `print -O json` and `balance --flat -O json` in one isolated scratch directory.
- Added transaction/account normalization and reconciliation in `prototype/hledger_adapter/normalize.py`.
- Updated `demo` and `smoke` so executed runs now emit normalized transactions, account balances, counts, and reconciliation checks.
- Verified both the 19-row baseline and 20-row baseline-plus-`TADD` scenarios.

### Why

Day 17 needed the first real workflow layer above backend invocation. The adapter now proves that synthetic CSV rows entered hledger as the expected two-posting transactions, that all implied accounts are loaded, and that account balances match reconciled postings before any Day 18 summary totals are calculated.

### Evidence / Files

- `prototype/hledger_adapter/models.py`
- `prototype/hledger_adapter/validation.py`
- `prototype/hledger_adapter/hledger.py`
- `prototype/hledger_adapter/normalize.py`
- `prototype/hledger_adapter/cli.py`
- `notes/day_17_transaction_account_reconciliation.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-13-2026_hledger-adapter_day17_reconciliation.txt`

### Next

Execute Day 18 by deriving controlled balance/report summaries from reconciled postings, including checking balance, bookkeeping income-statement cross-checks, Schedule C-style cash-expense groupings, and tax-adjacent facts.

## 07-13-2026 - Phase 16: Adapter Skeleton

### What Changed

- Scaffolded the Python prototype package under `prototype/hledger_adapter/` with module entry points, CLI parsing, structured adapter errors, and hledger process helpers.
- Added `prototype/pyproject.toml`, `prototype/.gitignore`, `prototype/config/category_map.json`, and `prototype/config/hledger.csv.rules`.
- Implemented category-map loading, synthetic transaction CSV validation, optional context loading, hledger binary discovery, version capture, scratch-copy execution, and a Day 16 read-only `print -O json` smoke call.
- Added working `validate`, `smoke`, `demo`, and `summarize --dry-run` command paths.
- Verified the canonical fixture with the Day 9 hledger 1.52.1 executable supplied via `--hledger-bin`; the smoke call reported 19 transactions and 38 postings.

### Why

Day 16 needed to turn the design contract into a runnable adapter shell without jumping ahead to full summary generation. The implementation proves that the wrapper can load committed configuration, enforce the synthetic fixture boundary, locate/probe hledger safely, and call the real backend through scratch copies.

### Evidence / Files

- `prototype/hledger_adapter/`
- `prototype/config/category_map.json`
- `prototype/config/hledger.csv.rules`
- `prototype/pyproject.toml`
- `prototype/.gitignore`
- `notes/day_16_adapter_skeleton.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-13-2026_hledger-adapter_day16_smoke.txt`

### Next

Execute Day 17 by implementing account loading, transaction normalization from hledger JSON, and reconciliation checks that prove the CSV rows became the expected balanced USD postings.

## 07-11-2026 - Phase 15: Prototype Design

### What Changed

- Designed the smallest useful hledger prototype as a local Python CLI over hledger's CSV, command-line, and JSON surfaces.
- Created an implementation-ready contract covering the CLI, transaction CSV, category map, optional mileage context, normalized JSON, errors, and exit codes.
- Chose one static adapter-owned hledger rules file and a separate strict category map.
- Defined read-only subprocess execution, binary discovery, dry-run behavior, scratch lifecycle, exact-decimal parsing, output reconciliation, and path redaction.
- Defined baseline, `TADD`, failure, safety, and repeatability acceptance criteria.
- Replaced the prototype placeholder README with a design-stage draft and created the Day 15 exit note.

### Why

Week 3 needed a narrow contract before scaffolding code. The design closes hledger's permissive duplicate-ID and unknown-category behavior at the wrapper boundary, keeps Schedule C-style aggregation separate from hledger's broader income statement, and preserves synthetic mileage without pretending to calculate tax treatment.

### Evidence / Files

- `prototype/design.md`
- `prototype/README.md`
- `notes/day_15_prototype_design.md`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `README.md`
- Supporting Day 9 hledger command/JSON evidence under `evidence/`

### Next

Execute Day 16 by scaffolding the Python adapter, committing the category map and static hledger rules, implementing configuration loading and hledger discovery/version capture, and proving a real read-only smoke call.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 14: Prototype Target Selection

### What Changed

- Built the Week 2 comparison matrix across hledger, Actual Budget, Firefly III, tenforty, and Filed Open Tax Engine.
- Scored candidates for prototype value, feasibility, safety, and demo clarity.
- Selected hledger as the primary Week 3 prototype target.
- Selected Actual Budget as the backup target.
- Created the Day 14 exit note and updated repository status.

### Why

Week 2 needed to turn five hands-on tool records into a concrete Week 3 build direction. hledger offers the clearest one-week prototype path because it completed the full synthetic transaction workflow with low setup friction, local file safety, and JSON output. Actual Budget is the closest backup because it preserves the same transaction-to-summary workflow through an official Node API.

### Evidence / Files

- `research/comparison_matrix.md`
- `research/prototype_target_decision.md`
- `notes/day_14_prototype_target_selection.md`
- `tool_records/tool_1.md`
- `tool_records/tool_2.md`
- `tool_records/tool_3.md`
- `tool_records/tool_4.md`
- `tool_records/tool_5.md`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 15 by creating `prototype/design.md`, defining the hledger adapter input/output schemas, documenting guardrails, and updating the prototype README outline.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 13: Evaluate Tool 5

### What Changed

- Evaluated Filed Open Tax Engine `v2.0.2` against the shared synthetic freelancer tax profile.
- Downloaded the official Windows x64 binary into `%TEMP%` and verified the release SHA-256 hash before use.
- Added a Filed/OpenTax-specific Node evaluation helper and normalized JSON/XML artifacts under `evidence/fixtures/`.
- Captured setup, version/schema, workflow, validation/export, and failure behavior transcripts under `evidence/commands/`.
- Created the completed fifth tool record at `tool_records/tool_5.md`.
- Created the Day 13 exit note at `notes/day_13_evaluate_filed_opentax.md`.
- Updated the rolling research log, fixture index, tool-record index, and README repository status.

### Why

Week 2 needed to finish the fifth shortlisted tool or close evaluation gaps before prototype target selection. Filed Open Tax Engine was evaluated because it is the shortlist's high-upside tax-specific CLI/JSON candidate, with form-entry schemas, 1040 line outputs, validation, dependency graph inspection, and MeF export.

### Evidence / Files

- `tool_records/tool_5.md`
- `notes/day_13_evaluate_filed_opentax.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_filed-opentax_setup.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_filed-opentax_version.txt`

- `evidence/fixtures/filed_opentax_day13_failure_results.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/filed_opentax_day13_baseline_mef.xml`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `evidence/fixtures/README.md`
- `tool_records/README.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 14 by building the comparison matrix across hledger, Actual Budget, Firefly III, tenforty, and Filed Open Tax Engine, then choose the primary Week 3 prototype target and backup target.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 12: Evaluate Tool 4

### What Changed

- Evaluated `tenforty==2025.10` against the shared synthetic freelancer tax profile.
- Captured native Windows setup failure and successful Docker/Linux evaluation evidence.
- Added a tenforty-specific Python evaluation helper and normalized JSON output artifacts under `evidence/fixtures/`.
- Captured setup, version, workflow, and failure behavior transcripts under `evidence/commands/`.
- Created the completed fourth tool record at `tool_records/tool_4.md`.
- Created the Day 12 exit note at `notes/day_12_evaluate_tenforty.md`.
- Updated the rolling research log, fixture index, tool-record index, and README repository status.

### Why

Week 2 needed a direct tax-calculation surface after three bookkeeping or personal-finance integration evaluations. tenforty was evaluated fourth because it wraps Open Tax Solver behind Python functions and provides structured tax-liability outputs from summarized tax inputs.

### Evidence / Files

- `tool_records/tool_4.md`
- `notes/day_12_evaluate_tenforty.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_tenforty_setup.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_tenforty_version.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_tenforty_workflow.txt`

- `evidence/fixtures/tenforty_day12_summary.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/tenforty_day12_scenario_grid.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/tenforty_day12_failure_results.json`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `evidence/fixtures/README.md`
- `tool_records/README.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 13 by evaluating Filed Open Tax Engine as the fifth candidate, or by closing gaps across the four completed records before Day 14 prototype target selection.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 11: Evaluate Tool 3

### What Changed

- Evaluated Firefly III `6.6.6` against the shared synthetic freelancer dataset.
- Ran Firefly III and MariaDB in isolated Docker containers, with local-only synthetic auth setup and redacted tokens.
- Added a Firefly-specific REST API evaluation helper and normalized JSON output artifacts under `evidence/fixtures/`.
- Captured setup, version, workflow, and failure behavior transcripts under `evidence/commands/`.
- Created the completed third tool record at `tool_records/tool_3.md`.
- Created the Day 11 exit note at `notes/day_11_evaluate_firefly_iii.md`.
- Updated the rolling research log, fixture index, tool-record index, and README repository status.

### Why

Week 2 needs comparable hands-on records across different integration styles. Firefly III was evaluated third because it represents the true REST JSON, self-hosted personal-finance API path, contrasting with hledger's file/CLI workflow and Actual Budget's local-first Node API/CLI workflow.

### Evidence / Files

- `tool_records/tool_3.md`
- `notes/day_11_evaluate_firefly_iii.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_firefly-iii_setup.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_firefly-iii_version.txt`

- `notes/research_log.md`
- `evidence/fixtures/README.md`
- `tool_records/README.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 12 by evaluating a fourth shortlisted tool or backup candidate, preferably a tax-specific candidate such as `tenforty`.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 10: Evaluate Tool 2

### What Changed

- Evaluated Actual Budget `26.7.0` against the shared synthetic freelancer dataset.
- Installed `@actual-app/api` and `@actual-app/cli` in a temporary npm directory without adding dependency artifacts to the repo.
- Added an Actual-specific Node API evaluation helper and normalized JSON output artifacts under `evidence/fixtures/`.
- Captured setup, version, common workflow, and failure behavior transcripts under `evidence/commands/`.
- Created the completed second tool record at `tool_records/tool_2.md`.
- Created the Day 10 exit note at `notes/day_10_evaluate_actual.md`.
- Updated the rolling research log, fixture index, tool-record index, and README repository status.

### Why

Week 2 needs comparable hands-on records across different integration styles. Actual Budget was evaluated second because it contrasts hledger's file/CLI/JSON workflow with a local-first app model, official Node API, and stable JSON-oriented CLI.

### Evidence / Files

- `tool_records/tool_2.md`
- `notes/day_10_evaluate_actual.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_actual_setup.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_actual_version.txt`

- `notes/research_log.md`
- `evidence/fixtures/README.md`
- `tool_records/README.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 11 by evaluating Firefly III as the REST/API-backed personal-finance comparator.

## 07-08-2026 - Phase 9: Evaluate Tool 1

### What Changed

- Evaluated hledger `1.52.1` against the shared synthetic freelancer dataset.
- Added hledger-specific CSV rules, `TADD`, bad-input fixtures, and JSON output artifacts under `evidence/fixtures/`.
- Captured setup, version, common workflow, and failure behavior transcripts under `evidence/commands/`.
- Created the completed first tool record at `tool_records/tool_1.md`.
- Created the Day 9 exit note at `notes/day_09_evaluate_hledger.md`.
- Updated the rolling research log, fixture index, tool-record index, and README repository status.

### Why

Week 2 needs comparable hands-on records for each shortlisted tool. hledger was evaluated first because it is the fastest low-setup candidate for validating the shared CSV-to-report workflow and testing whether the evaluation method produces useful evidence.

### Evidence / Files

- `tool_records/tool_1.md`
- `notes/day_09_evaluate_hledger.md`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_hledger_setup.txt`
- `evidence/commands/07-08-2026_hledger_version.txt`

- `evidence/fixtures/hledger_duplicate_t001.csv`
- `evidence/fixtures/hledger_day9_baseline_print.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/hledger_day9_baseline_checking_balance.json`
- `evidence/fixtures/hledger_day9_with_tadd_print.json`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 10 by evaluating Actual Budget against the same synthetic dataset and comparing its setup, structured output, and failure behavior with hledger.

## 07-07-2026 - Phase 8: Evaluation Harness and Synthetic Data

### What Changed

- Created `evidence/synthetic_dataset.md` with a synthetic 2025 freelancer scenario, canonical transactions, mileage metadata, expected totals, tool adaptation notes, and failure-test inputs.
- Created machine-readable fixtures at `evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_transactions.csv` and `evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_tax_profile.json`.
- Created `research/evaluation_checklist.md` with shared setup, workflow, tax-coverage, failure-testing, evidence, and tool-record checklists.
- Created the Day 8 exit note at `notes/day_08_evaluation_harness_and_synthetic_data.md`.
- Updated the rolling research log, fixture README, and README repository status.

### Why

Week 2 needs a shared evaluation harness so hledger, Actual Budget, Firefly III, tenforty, and Filed Open Tax Engine are tested against the same synthetic facts instead of ad hoc examples. The dataset also keeps bookkeeping and tax-oriented tools comparable while respecting their different input surfaces.

### Evidence / Files

- `evidence/synthetic_dataset.md`
- `evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_transactions.csv`
- `evidence/fixtures/synthetic_freelancer_tax_profile.json`
- `research/evaluation_checklist.md`
- `notes/day_08_evaluation_harness_and_synthetic_data.md`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `evidence/fixtures/README.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 9 by evaluating hledger against the shared dataset and filling the first tool record.

## 07-07-2026 - Phase 7: Shortlist Decision

### What Changed

- Created `research/shortlist.md` with a score matrix, selection rationale, major exclusions, backups, Week 2 evaluation order, and carry-forward risks.
- Created the Day 7 exit note at `notes/day_07_shortlist_decision.md`.
- Updated `notes/research_log.md` and the README repository status for Phase 7 completion.
- Selected hledger, Actual Budget, Firefly III, tenforty, and Filed Open Tax Engine for Week 2 hands-on evaluation.

### Why

The project needed to turn the Week 1 landscape, health, and programmatic-surface evidence into a concrete Week 2 evaluation target list. The selected tools balance plain-text accounting, personal-finance app integration, REST/API coverage, and tax-specific calculation or form-engine workflows.

### Evidence / Files

- `research/shortlist.md`
- `notes/day_07_shortlist_decision.md`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 8 by creating `evidence/synthetic_dataset.md` and `research/evaluation_checklist.md` for a shared hands-on evaluation harness.

## 07-06-2026 - Phase 6: Programmatic Surface Survey

### What Changed

- Created `research/programmatic_surface_survey.md` with a documented comparison of CLI, library, REST API, plugin, file-format, schema, database, and structured-output surfaces.
- Created the Day 6 exit note at `notes/day_06_programmatic_surface_survey.md`.
- Updated `notes/research_log.md` and the README repository status for Phase 6 completion.
- Aligned the Day 6 roadmap entry to the created `research/programmatic_surface_survey.md` artifact name.
- Identified hledger, Actual Budget, Firefly III, Beancount, tenforty, and Filed Open Tax Engine as the clearest code-facing candidates going into Day 7.

### Why

The project needed to compare which candidates can be driven from code before spending Week 2 time installing tools. The Day 5 health snapshot showed which projects were alive; Day 6 distinguishes which ones expose realistic automation surfaces.

### Evidence / Files

- `research/programmatic_surface_survey.md`
- `notes/day_06_programmatic_surface_survey.md`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `research/README.md`
- `day_by_day_ai_tax_tooling_phases.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 7 by creating `research/shortlist.md`, scoring plausible candidates, and choosing 3-5 tools for hands-on evaluation.

## 07-05-2026 - Phase 5: Metadata and Health Snapshot

### What Changed

- Created `research/project_health_snapshot.md` with normalized activity, release/package, license, community, documentation, tax-year, and data-format notes for plausible candidates.
- Created the Day 5 exit note at `notes/day_05_metadata_health_snapshot.md`.
- Updated `notes/research_log.md` and the README repository status for Phase 5 completion.
- Separated core shortlist-pressure candidates from supporting import, UI, and desktop comparators.

### Why

The project needs comparable health evidence before the Day 6 programmatic-surface survey and Day 7 shortlist decision. The Day 4 longlist was broad, but its metadata was uneven across GitHub, PyPI, SourceForge, IRS pages, and project docs.

### Evidence / Files

- `research/project_health_snapshot.md`
- `notes/day_05_metadata_health_snapshot.md`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 6 by creating `research/programmatic_surface_survey.md` and comparing documented/inferred automation surfaces across the strongest candidates.

## 07-05-2026 - Phase 4: Discovery Search

### What Changed

- Expanded `research/longlist.md` beyond the starter candidates with newly discovered tax-specific, tax-model, personal-finance, UI, and import-layer tools.
- Promoted UsTaxes, HabuTax, Filed Open Tax Engine, PSL Tax-Calculator, PolicyEngine US, IRS Tax Withholding Estimator, tenforty, OpenFile, Actual Budget, KMyMoney, HomeBank, Money Manager Ex, Fava, Paisa, and ofxstatement.
- Created `research/exclusions.md` to record tools excluded or deferred because of license, scope, project health, maturity, narrowness, or lack of open/local inspectability.
- Added the Day 4 exit note and updated the rolling research log.

### Why

The project needed a broader discovery pass before Day 5 health snapshots and the Day 7 shortlist decision. The starter list was strong, but it missed several directly relevant US tax-form and tax-model projects plus stronger API/CLI personal-finance comparators.

### Evidence / Files

- `research/longlist.md`
- `research/exclusions.md`
- `notes/day_04_discovery_search.md`
- `notes/research_log.md`

### Next

Execute Day 5 by creating `research/project_health_snapshot.md` and normalizing release dates, recent commits, licenses, contributor signals, documentation quality, annual tax-year support, and data-format evidence for plausible candidates.

## 07-04-2026 - Phase 3: Starter Tool Inventory

### What Changed

- Created `research/longlist.md` with structured starter entries for GnuCash, Beancount, Ledger CLI, hledger, Firefly III, OpenTaxSolver, IRS Direct File posture, OFX/QIF parser tooling, and CSV-to-ledger tooling.
- Captured first-pass project URLs, docs URLs, licenses, latest visible release/status notes, categories, apparent integration surfaces, and immediately visible wrappers or adjacent tools.
- Added source IDs and access dates inside the longlist so later report claims can trace back to primary sources.
- Updated the research log and README status for Phase 3 completion.

### Why

The project needed a baseline tool inventory before Day 4 discovery, Day 5 health snapshots, Day 6 programmatic-surface comparison, and the Day 7 shortlist decision.

### Evidence / Files

- `research/longlist.md`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 4 discovery search, expand `research/longlist.md` with credible additional tools, and create `research/exclusions.md` for tools that are closed-source, irrelevant, abandoned, or outside the consumer/freelancer scope.

## 07-03-2026 - Project Tracking and Brief Alignment

### What Changed

- Created this changelog and backfilled entries for Day 1 and Day 2.
- Reviewed the attached internship description PDF against the execution plan, day-by-day phase plan, README, and day notes.
- Added `notes/internship_brief_alignment.md` to capture what the project brief requires and how the repository now tracks it.
- Updated the execution plan, day-by-day plan, README, and tool-record template to make several brief details explicit.

### Why

The project needed one central history file for easier backtracking. The PDF also included details that were partly implicit in the existing plans, such as third-party wrappers, exact US tax-form prompts, tool non-goals, annual tax-year support, and mentorship/logistics expectations.

### Evidence / Files

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `notes/internship_brief_alignment.md`
- `codex_execution_plan_ai_tax_tooling.md`
- `day_by_day_ai_tax_tooling_phases.md`
- `tool_records/template.md`
- `README.md`

### Next

Execute Day 3 by creating `research/longlist.md` for the starter candidate tools and capturing first-pass metadata, docs links, releases, licenses, categories, and apparent integration surfaces.

## 07-02-2026 - Phase 2: Workspace and Evidence System

### What Changed

- Created the main workspace folders: `research/`, `tool_records/`, `prototype/`, `report/`, `deck/`, `notes/`, and `evidence/`.
- Added README files so each workspace folder is trackable in git and has a defined purpose.
- Created evidence subfolders for commands, repository metadata, documentation notes, screenshots, and synthetic fixtures.
- Created the rolling research log at `notes/research_log.md`.
- Created the source-citation convention at `notes/source_citation_conventions.md`.
- Created the reusable tool-record template at `tool_records/template.md`.
- Wrote the Day 2 exit note at `notes/day_02_workspace_and_evidence.md`.
- Updated the README repository status to show Phase 2 completion.

### Why

Future research needs a consistent home for findings, source links, command output, metadata, screenshots, and evaluation records. The scaffold also keeps the final report evidence-backed instead of memory-driven.

### Evidence / Files

- `notes/day_02_workspace_and_evidence.md`
- `notes/research_log.md`
- `notes/source_citation_conventions.md`

## 07-01-2026 - Phase 1: Kickoff and Source Understanding

### What Changed

- Read the project brief and turned it into a concrete execution plan.
- Defined the research question around open-source consumer tax bookkeeping, US tax-return tooling, and programmatic integration surfaces.
- Identified the three final deliverables: written report, prototype integration, and presentation deck.
- Created the month-long execution plan.
- Created the day-by-day phase plan.
- Wrote the Day 1 kickoff note.

### Why

The internship needed a clear scope, timeline, rubric, and daily operating rhythm before research and prototype work could begin.

### Evidence / Files
