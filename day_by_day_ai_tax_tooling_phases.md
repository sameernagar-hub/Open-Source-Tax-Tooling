# Day-by-Day Research Phases: Open-Source Tax Tooling and API Connectivity

## How To Use This File

This is the working roadmap for the 07-01-2026 through 07-31-2026 internship. Each day is treated as its own phase with a specific research objective, concrete tasks, and an exit artifact. The point is to move one day at a time while still steering toward the end goal: a publishable report, a working prototype integration, and a presentation deck.

Daily rhythm:

- Start by reading the previous day's exit artifact.
- Do the day's research or build work.
- Save notes, commands, links, and evidence.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` when a work session changes project direction, artifacts, prototype code, report/deck content, or repository structure.
- End by writing the day's artifact before moving on.

## End Goal

By 07-31-2026, deliver:

- A written research report on open-source consumer tax bookkeeping and tax-return tooling.
- A working prototype integration using synthetic data only.
- A 20-30 minute presentation deck.

Objective: turn the starter list into a structured longlist.

Tasks:

- Create longlist entries for GnuCash, Beancount, Ledger CLI, HLedger, Firefly III, OpenTaxSolver, IRS Direct File posture, OFX/QIF tooling, and CSV-to-ledger tooling.
- For each entry, capture repo or project URL, docs URL, license, latest visible release, and apparent integration surface.

- Add quick notes on whether the tool is bookkeeping, tax calculation, tax submission, or adjacent infrastructure.

Exit artifact:
