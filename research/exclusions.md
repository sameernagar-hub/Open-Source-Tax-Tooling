# Discovery Exclusions

Day 4 artifact for Phase 4: Discovery Search.

Planned phase date: 07-04-2026. Executed on 07-05-2026. An exclusion here does not mean a tool is bad; it means the tool is not a strong fit for the main consumer/freelancer-oriented, open-source tax-tooling shortlist as currently scoped. Some entries remain useful as background or prior art.

## Exclusion Matrix

| Tool / source | Exclusion type | Why it is excluded or deferred | Revisit condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Akaunting | License / scope | Repository README says Akaunting is released under the BSL license. It is also small-business/freelancer accounting software rather than consumer tax preparation. | Revisit only if the mentor wants business accounting systems or non-OSI source-available tools in scope. |
| ERPNext | Scope | Full enterprise resource planning system with accounting, inventory, order management, manufacturing, assets, projects, and HR. Too broad for the consumer/freelancer tax-tooling comparison. | Revisit only as an API architecture comparator if Week 1 lacks any API-native accounting examples. |
| OpenTaxForms | Health / active-candidate fit | Relevant IRS-form extraction prior art, but the README warns the project needs a redesign and has no e-file capability. | Cite as form/PDF/API prior art; do not treat as a hands-on candidate unless the project shifts to form-schema extraction. |
| Python-Taxes | Narrow helper | Python library for Social Security, Medicare, and Federal Income Tax withholding calculations; useful, but narrower than return prep, bookkeeping, or tax-line mapping. | Revisit if W-4/payroll-withholding math becomes part of the prototype. |
| TaxStuff | Maturity / caution | Basic federal tax-return calculator that explicitly says it is a work in progress and not a substitute for filing software. | Revisit only if looking for historical hobby-project examples of 1040 calculation logic. |
| Maybe Finance | Project health | Repository notice says it is no longer actively maintained. | Revisit only if project maintenance resumes or a maintained fork becomes clear. |
| Kresus | Geography / scope | Libre self-hosted personal finance manager focused on server-side bank retrieval and budgeting; useful, but no US tax relevance or clear programmatic tax surface was found in the Day 4 pass. | Revisit if non-US bank-aggregation/API patterns become a mentor-requested comparator. |
| ezBookkeeping | Relevance / surface unclear | Self-hosted personal finance app, but no clear tax-line mapping, US tax workflow, or documented integration surface surfaced during Day 4. | Revisit if Day 5 needs more self-hosted personal-finance comparators. |
| Skrooge | Duplication / surface unclear | KDE personal-finance app, but KMyMoney has clearer import/export documentation and a closer Quicken-like comparator role for this study. | Revisit if KMyMoney proves unusable locally. |
| NBER TAXSIM | Not a local open-source candidate | Important external benchmark/service for tax calculations, but not a public, locally inspectable open-source tool for this internship's prototype path. | Use as background or validation context only. |
| IRS Free File Fillable Forms | Closed/hosted service | Official free filing pathway, but not an open-source local tool or API/library candidate. | Use only as context for the broader filing ecosystem. |
| Commercial consumer tax products | Closed source | TurboTax, H&R Block, TaxAct, and similar products are important market context but do not satisfy the open-source/publicly inspectable criterion. | Mention only as closed-source contrast in the final landscape section. |

## Notes

- Tools that are merely lower priority but still credible, such as HomeBank, Money Manager Ex, Fava, Paisa, and ofxstatement, were added to `research/longlist.md` instead of excluded.
- OpenFile was promoted to the longlist with a strong accuracy/status caveat because it is a public Direct File fork and was already visible in the Day 3 source index.
- Exclusions should be rechecked only if they affect the Day 7 shortlist decision.
