# Comparison Matrix

Day 14 artifact for Phase 14: Prototype Target Selection.

Planned phase date: 07-14-2026. Executed early on 07-09-2026 UTC / 07-08-2026 PDT at user request.

## Purpose

Compare the five Week 2 hands-on evaluations and choose the tool target that gives Week 3 the best combination of prototype value, feasibility, safety, and demo clarity.

Primary evidence base:

- `tool_records/tool_1.md`: hledger Day 9 evaluation.
- `tool_records/tool_2.md`: Actual Budget Day 10 evaluation.
- `tool_records/tool_3.md`: Firefly III Day 11 evaluation.
- `tool_records/tool_4.md`: tenforty Day 12 evaluation.
- `tool_records/tool_5.md`: Filed Open Tax Engine Day 13 evaluation.
- `research/evaluation_checklist.md`: shared workflow, expected totals, and failure-test checklist.

## Executive Read

The five tools split into three useful roles:

| Role | Strongest candidates | Main finding |
|---|---|---|
| Bookkeeping-to-report adapter | hledger, Actual Budget, Firefly III | All three can ingest or model the synthetic freelancer facts and emit structured summaries, but hledger has the lowest setup cost and most transparent data path. |
| Tax-liability calculator | tenforty | Strong structured Python calculation surface, but it needs a separate summarization layer and has no transaction store, forms, payments/refunds, PDFs, or e-file path. |
| Form-level tax engine | Filed Open Tax Engine | Highest form-level tax upside, with 1040/Schedule C/SE line outputs and MeF export, but validation/export noise and project maturity make it risky as the first Week 3 build target. |

Decision: use hledger as the primary Week 3 prototype target. Use Actual Budget as the backup target because it preserves the same transaction-to-summary demo shape with an official Node API and MIT license. Keep tenforty and Filed Open Tax Engine in the report as tax-specific findings and possible future components, not the first prototype target.

## Scoring Method

Scores are 1-5, where 5 is strongest for the Week 3 prototype. The total is directional; the decision also considers whether a candidate can support the planned one-week demo without making unsupported tax or filing claims.

| Dimension | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Prototype value | How well the tool proves the research question through a real programmatic surface and useful synthetic-data workflow. |
| Feasibility | Likelihood of building a small, repeatable Week 3 adapter with local setup and predictable dependencies. |
| Safety | Quality of scratch-data support, failure behavior, validation/dry-run options, and guardrail needs. |
| Demo clarity | How easily a reviewer can understand, run, and inspect the integration end to end. |

## Prototype Selection Score Matrix

| Candidate | Prototype value | Feasibility | Safety | Demo clarity | Total | Prototype role | Main risks |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| hledger | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 18 | Primary target | No native tax calculation/forms; wrapper must reject unknown categories and duplicate IDs before hledger accepts them. |
| Filed Open Tax Engine | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 16 | High-upside tax-engine candidate | Young project, AGPL/commercial licensing, validation/export noise, duplicate inputs accepted, malformed date strings accepted. |
| Actual Budget | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 15 | Backup target | No tax forms; direct adds accepted unknown category IDs and duplicate imported IDs; app-owned local data model. |
| tenforty | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 15 | Tax-calculation component candidate | Native Windows install failed; no transaction import; no payments/refund model; suspicious effective-rate output needs wrapper checks. |
| Firefly III | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 14 | REST-first comparator | Docker/auth setup, AGPL obligations, no transaction dry-run found, unknown categories can auto-create. |

## Candidate Notes

### hledger

hledger is the strongest Week 3 target because it already completed the full transaction workflow with local files, deterministic CLI calls, and JSON output. It is not a tax-preparation engine, so the prototype should frame itself as bookkeeping-to-tax-summary infrastructure: validate categories, run read-only reports, and return normalized summaries suitable for later tax calculation or report writing.

### Actual Budget

Actual Budget is the best backup because it keeps the same demonstration shape as hledger while using an official Node API instead of a plain-text CLI. It is also MIT-licensed and easy to run locally. The prototype would need stronger wrapper validation around categories and imported IDs than the raw API enforced during Day 10.

### Firefly III

Firefly III is the clearest REST-first comparator, but Docker, auth, database state, AGPL licensing, and lack of a transaction dry-run endpoint add overhead. It should remain important in the report's "best REST API" category, but it is not the lowest-risk Week 3 prototype.

### tenforty

tenforty is the strongest compact tax-calculation component. It should be preserved as a future second-stage adapter idea, especially for converting hledger/Actual/Firefly summaries into federal tax-liability estimates. As a standalone Week 3 target, it does not exercise transaction import, balances, or tax-form generation, and native Windows setup failed.

### Filed Open Tax Engine

Filed Open Tax Engine has the highest tax-form upside. It is the only evaluated tool that produced 1040 line outputs, Schedule C/SE-style calculations, payments/refund outputs, validation summaries, graph/schema inspection, and MeF XML evidence in one CLI. It should not be the primary Week 3 target unless the mentor explicitly prioritizes form-level experimentation over reliability, because validation/export noise and maturity risk would dominate the prototype.

## Decision Summary

- Primary prototype target: hledger.
- Backup prototype target: Actual Budget.
- Tax-specific future component: tenforty.
- High-upside form-engine research candidate: Filed Open Tax Engine.
- REST-first comparator for the final report: Firefly III.

## Day 15 Starting Point

Start `prototype/design.md` by defining a small hledger CLI adapter:

- Input: canonical synthetic CSV plus a strict category/tax-hint allowlist.
- Operations: validate fixture, generate or reuse hledger rules, run `print`, `balance`, and `incomestatement`, then normalize JSON/text output.
- Output: checking balance, income/expense categories, Schedule C-style summary, unmapped tax facts, and wrapper warnings.
- Guardrails: synthetic-only fixtures, scratch output directory, duplicate ID detection, unknown category rejection, no mutation of user files, and clear GPL scope note.
