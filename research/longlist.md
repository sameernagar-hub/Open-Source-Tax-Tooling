# Tool Longlist

Day 3 artifact for Phase 3: Starter Tool Inventory, expanded during Day 4 discovery search.

Planned starter-inventory date: 07-03-2026. Day 3 source access date: 07-04-2026. Day 4 discovery executed on 07-05-2026 for the planned 07-04-2026 phase. This is still a first-pass inventory, not a final health assessment. Release and activity metadata should be normalized in `research/project_health_snapshot.md` during Day 5.

## Candidate Entries

### GnuCash

- Project URL: https://github.com/Gnucash/gnucash
- Docs URL: https://www.gnucash.org/docs.phtml
- License: GnuCash's license file describes a mutually compatible license set, with most source under GPL-2.0-or-later and some files under GPL-2/GPL-3-compatible terms.
- Latest visible release: 5.16, released 06-28-2026.
- Category: bookkeeping / personal finance; tax-adjacent through reports, account structure, and import/export rather than tax calculation or e-file.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Native files and SQL-backed book storage.
  - Import/export surfaces for common finance data such as QIF, OFX/HBCI/AqBanking, and CSV-style workflows.
  - Optional Python bindings for manipulating GnuCash data. The docs warn that Python support depends on build/package options.
  - `gnucash-cli` report automation is visible in release/user-list material and should be tested locally before relying on it.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - `piecash` provides a Pythonic interface to GnuCash SQL documents.
  - Small helper projects exist around QIF import and report extraction, but they look uneven and should not be assumed maintained.
- First-pass fit:
  - Useful representative of GUI/full personal-finance software.
  - Integration may be heavier than plain-text tools because install/build flags and data-file locking matter.

### Beancount

- Project URL: https://github.com/beancount/beancount
- Docs URL: https://beancount.github.io/docs/
- License: GPL-2.0-only.
- Latest visible release: 3.2.3 on PyPI, uploaded 05-05-2026.
- Category: plain-text double-entry bookkeeping; tax-adjacent reporting, not tax filing.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Plain-text ledger language with Python parsing and in-memory data structures.
  - CLI/report tools, SQL-like query tooling, and a web reporting interface.
  - Import scaffolding for converting external bank data to Beancount syntax.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - `beangulp` is the Beancount 3 importer framework and replaces older `beancount.ingest` patterns.
  - `smart_importer` adds ML-assisted import hooks for predicting payees/postings.
  - `beancount-import` offers a web UI for semi-automatic import and reconciliation.
  - Fava is a widely used web UI in the ecosystem and should be noted during discovery/health review.
- First-pass fit:
  - Strong candidate for a prototype adapter because the source format is explicit, version-controllable, and easy to generate from synthetic data.
  - Needs separate tax-line mapping if the project wants tax-form semantics.

### Ledger CLI

- Project URL: https://github.com/ledger/ledger
- Docs URL: https://ledger-cli.org/doc/ledger3.html
- License: BSD-style license; downstream packages identify it as BSD-3-Clause.
- Latest visible release: v3.4.1, released 10-26-2025.
- Category: plain-text double-entry bookkeeping; tax-adjacent reporting, not tax calculation or submission.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - CLI-first workflow over plain-text journal files.
  - Reports can be driven from shell scripts against generated or edited journal files.
  - C++ API documentation exists, but the first practical integration surface is likely CLI/file based.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - `ledger-autosync` pulls transactions via bank/OFX flows into Ledger files.
  - `ledger-mode` provides editor integration and workflow support.
  - Curated "awesome ledger" lists suggest a broader helper ecosystem worth reviewing on Day 4.
- First-pass fit:
  - Good baseline for command-line accounting.
  - Prototype value depends on whether output parsing can stay structured enough for reliable automation.

### hledger

- Project URL: https://github.com/simonmichael/hledger
- Docs URL: https://hledger.org/manual.html
- License: GPL-3.0-or-later.
- Latest visible release: 1.52.1, released 04-28-2026.
- Category: plain-text double-entry bookkeeping with stronger built-in API/export story.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - CLI, terminal UI, and web UI over hledger/ledger-style journals.
  - Built-in CSV converter using rules files.
  - JSON output for reports and hledger-web JSON-over-HTTP API.
  - hledger-web documentation mentions an API-only serving mode and routes for version, account names, transactions, prices, commodities, accounts, and account transactions.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - Many workflows appear to use hledger's own web/API/export surfaces rather than separate wrappers.
  - Ledger and Beancount interoperability is explicit in hledger documentation and should be tested later.
- First-pass fit:
  - One of the most promising integration candidates because it combines plain-text data with structured JSON/API output.
  - Tax coverage is indirect and would need mapping logic.

### Firefly III

- Project URL: https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii
- Docs URL: https://docs.firefly-iii.org/
- API docs URL: https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org/
- License: AGPL-3.0.
- Latest visible release: v6.6.6, released 07-01-2026.
- Category: self-hosted personal finance / budgeting; tax-adjacent bookkeeping and reporting, not a tax-form or filing system.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - JSON REST API with dedicated API documentation and Swagger/OpenAPI-style interaction.
  - Self-hosted web app, usually Docker-friendly.
  - Data Importer is a separate companion project for importing transactions.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - Official docs list third-party apps built around the Firefly III API.
  - Firefly III Data Importer is official-adjacent and should be evaluated as part of the import workflow.
- First-pass fit:
  - Strong API-native candidate if the prototype favors REST integration.
  - Heavier setup than plain-text tools and less directly tax-specific.

### OpenTaxSolver

- Project URL: https://sourceforge.net/projects/opentaxsolver/
- Website / download URL: https://opentaxsolver.sourceforge.net/
- License: GPL-2.0.
- Latest visible release: 23.06 for the 2025 tax year, visible on SourceForge 03-20-2026.
- Category: US tax calculation / tax form preparation; prints/fills forms for mailing rather than acting as a general bookkeeping system.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Local desktop/terminal-style C application with graphical and textual interfaces.
  - Source-distributed form calculators and build scripts inside downloadable packages.
  - Outputs appear oriented around filled/printed forms rather than APIs or structured machine output.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - None obvious in the first pass.
- First-pass fit:
  - Important because it is closer to actual US tax-form calculation than bookkeeping tools.
  - Likely weak for thin API integration unless the textual interface or generated files can be driven safely from scripts.

### IRS Direct File Posture

- Project URL: https://github.com/IRS-Public/direct-file
- IRS status page: https://www.irs.gov/filing/irs-direct-file-for-free
- License: public domain within the United States and CC0 1.0 worldwide for released code.
- Latest visible release/status:
  - No conventional releases observed.
  - IRS page says Direct File is no longer available.
  - Repository README says the repo is archived/no longer maintained, historical reference only, and not for production systems.
- Category: tax preparation / federal filing reference; not a current open filing channel.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Reference implementation for interview-based federal return preparation.
  - Fact Graph declarative XML/Scala rules engine.
  - Translation to standard tax forms and IRS Modernized e-File (MeF) path for authorized public use.
  - State API transferring standard MeF XML plus enriched JSON to third-party/state tools.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - OpenFile is an immediately visible fork based on IRS Direct File. Its README states that it makes no guarantees of accuracy and notes the official Direct File project's suspension.
- First-pass fit:
  - Very useful as architecture and schema prior art.
  - Not suitable as an active tax-submission prototype unless the project explicitly frames it as historical/reference-only.

### OpenFile

- Project URL: https://github.com/openfiletax/openfile
- Docs URL: https://docs.openfile.tax/en/latest/reference.html
- License: repository has a visible license file, but exact terms were not normalized during Day 4; verify before relying on it.
- Latest visible release/status:
  - No GitHub releases were published in the Day 4 pass.
  - README states the project makes no guarantees of accuracy and notes the official Direct File project's suspension.
- Category: Direct File fork / tax preparation reference.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Dockerized application forked from IRS Direct File.
  - Inherits much of the upstream architecture surface, including client and state-API-oriented components, but should not be treated as equivalent to an IRS-supported filing channel.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - The tool itself is the visible fork of IRS Direct File.
- First-pass fit:
  - Worth promoting out of the IRS Direct File note because it is a live-looking public fork.
  - Accuracy and release status caveats make it risky as a prototype target until Day 5/6 evidence says otherwise.

### OFX/QIF Parser Tooling

- Representative project URLs:
  - ofxtools: https://github.com/csingley/ofxtools
  - ofxparse: https://github.com/jseutter/ofxparse

  - qifparse 0.5, released 11-03-2013.
- Category: adjacent import infrastructure for bank/brokerage files.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Python libraries and command-style tooling for parsing, generating, or downloading financial exchange data.
  - Useful for feeding bookkeeping tools with synthetic OFX/QIF examples.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - These are themselves integration-layer tools; downstream usage needs discovery.
- First-pass fit:
  - Not a tax tool by itself, but useful for a prototype that demonstrates bank-file ingestion into a ledger or personal-finance app.
  - qifparse looks old; ofxtools appears much more current.

  - ledger-autosync 1.2.0 on PyPI, uploaded 08-22-2024; GitHub latest release page showed v1.0.2 from 2020, so PyPI/GitHub release metadata should be reconciled later.
- Category: adjacent import automation and prior art for code-driven bookkeeping.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Rules-based CSV conversion into hledger journals.
  - Beancount import frameworks that emit Beancount entries from external files.
  - ML-assisted categorization hooks for Beancount importers.
  - OFX/bank synchronization workflows for Ledger.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - These tools are direct prior art for the project prototype.
  - They point toward a practical pattern: normalize CSV/OFX/QIF input into plain-text ledger entries, then compute reports through a mature accounting engine.
- First-pass fit:
  - Very relevant for the prototype even if not evaluated as standalone final candidates.
  - Best treated as supporting infrastructure around Beancount, Ledger, or hledger.

  - JSON-oriented return creation, form-node insertion, and return retrieval examples.
  - Repository includes form folders, a catalog, CLI code, docs, and agent-oriented skill/plugin material.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - The project itself is explicitly agent-oriented and publishes MCP/skill-style materials, but those should be treated as project-provided surfaces rather than independent validation.
- First-pass fit:
  - Highly relevant to the internship's AI-agent-consumable integration question.
  - Newer and lower social proof than older tools, so Day 5 should scrutinize tests, release cadence, coverage, and accuracy disclaimers.

### PSL Tax-Calculator

- Project URL: https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator
- Docs URL: https://taxcalc.pslmodels.org/
- License: CC0-1.0 is visible in the repository badge; verify the license file during Day 5.

- Apparent integration surface:
  - Python package installable with PyPI or conda.
  - Documented Python API, command-line interface, input variables, output variables, and policy/assumption parameters.
  - Can process custom-created filing-unit data as well as prepared sample data for aggregate analysis.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - Policy Simulation Library ecosystem and TaxData are adjacent infrastructure, but not direct consumer preparation tools.
- First-pass fit:
  - Excellent programmatic comparator for tax calculation and transparent modeling.
  - Not a consumer return-preparation or filing tool, so shortlist value depends on whether the project wants a model comparator.

### PolicyEngine US

- Project URL: https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us
- Website / docs URL: https://policyengine.org/us
- Related rules-engine pattern: https://openfisca.org/en/

- Category: US federal/state tax-benefit rules engine and microsimulation model.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Python package containing US tax-benefit rules and household-level calculations.
  - PolicyEngine web app/API and OpenFisca-style JSON/Python API patterns are relevant programmatic comparators.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - `policyengine.py` is the recommended managed bundle for broader microsimulation workflows.
- First-pass fit:
  - Useful for rules-as-code, variable/parameter modeling, and API/schema comparison.
  - Not a tax filing or consumer bookkeeping tool; should be treated as a comparator rather than a direct prototype target unless tax-calculation modeling becomes central.

  - Returns structured Python/Pydantic-style outputs and supports dataframe-style scenario sweeps.
  - Built on top of OpenTaxSolver.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - It is itself a wrapper over OpenTaxSolver and therefore important prior art if OpenTaxSolver is otherwise hard to automate.
- First-pass fit:
  - Promising bridge between a tax-form-oriented tool and a Python integration surface.
  - Needs direct install/test validation because it inherits limits from OpenTaxSolver and supports only selected states.

- Category: desktop personal accounting / personal finance.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Desktop app with import/export, templates, category splits, scheduled transactions, duplicate detection, and assignment rules.
  - FAQ/docs mention CSV workflows and common personal-finance bank formats.
  - No obvious stable public API found during Day 4.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - ofxstatement explicitly targets HomeBank as one destination for generated OFX.
- First-pass fit:
  - Plausible consumer-finance comparator but likely lower priority than GnuCash, KMyMoney, Firefly III, and Actual because automation appears file-driven.

### Money Manager Ex

- Project URL: https://github.com/moneymanagerex/moneymanagerex
- Website / docs URL: https://moneymanagerex.org/
- Import/export docs: https://moneymanagerex.org/docs/features/importexport/
- License: GPL-2.0.
- Latest visible release/status:
  - Stable release links were visible, but exact release metadata should be normalized during Day 5.
- Category: desktop/mobile personal finance manager.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Desktop and mobile apps backed by a nonproprietary SQLite database.
  - Import/export docs list QIF, CSV, HTML, and XML.
  - CSV importer can accept user-selected field order instead of one fixed column order.
  - No obvious stable public API found during Day 4.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - Android companion app and shared database/file workflows are visible from the project ecosystem.
- First-pass fit:
  - Useful as a mainstream personal-finance comparator with a durable SQLite/storage story.
  - Likely weaker than Actual/Firefly III for API-style integration.

### Fava

- Project URL: https://github.com/beancount/fava
- Docs URL: https://beancount.github.io/fava/
- License: MIT.
- Latest visible release/status:
  - GitHub showed tags and a PyPI version badge, but exact version/release date should be normalized during Day 5.
- Category: Beancount web UI / plain-text-accounting ecosystem component.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Python package launched as `fava ledger.beancount`.
  - Web interface over a Beancount ledger.
  - Documentation includes API documentation and extension/plugin namespaces.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - Fava is already a major Beancount ecosystem integration.
- First-pass fit:
  - Important prior art for turning a plain-text ledger into a richer web workflow.
  - Probably not a standalone shortlist tool unless Beancount is shortlisted and Fava becomes part of the evaluation stack.

### Paisa

- Project URL: https://github.com/ananthakumaran/paisa
- Website / docs URL: https://paisa.fyi/
- Related hledger note: https://hledger.org/paisa.html
- License: AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- Latest visible release: v0.7.4, latest visible GitHub release dated 08-03-2025.
- Category: plain-text-accounting web UI / personal-finance reporting.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Reads Ledger, hledger, or Beancount files.
  - Uses a SQLite database generated from the source journal.
  - Provides reports, charts, investment tracking, and a web UI.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - The hledger project documents Paisa as a related web app and notes hledger support caveats.
- First-pass fit:
  - Valuable comparator for UI/reporting on top of plain-text accounting.
  - Focused partly on Indian users and market data, so US tax relevance is indirect.

### ofxstatement

- Project URL: https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement
- License: GPL-3.0.
- Latest visible release: 0.9.2, latest visible GitHub release dated 11-25-2024.
- Category: bank-statement conversion / adjacent import infrastructure.
- Apparent integration surface:
  - Python CLI `ofxstatement`.
  - Plugin system for converting proprietary bank statement exports to OFX.
  - Intended workflow is export from bank, convert to OFX, then import into accounting software.
- Obvious third-party wrappers / integrations:
  - README lists many bank-specific plugins and a sample plugin project.
- First-pass fit:
  - Strong prior art for synthetic bank-file ingestion into GnuCash, HomeBank, or other OFX-capable tools.
  - Not a standalone tax or bookkeeping tool.

## Immediate Follow-Up Questions

- Should the shortlist prioritize a REST-first path, represented by Firefly III, or a file/CLI-first path, represented by Beancount/hledger/Ledger?
- Can OpenTaxSolver be driven repeatably through textual input/output, or is it better treated as a manual/reference tax-form comparator?
- Does GnuCash's optional Python binding setup work cleanly in the local environment, especially on Windows?
- Does OpenFile's Direct File fork have enough independent accuracy, maintenance, and licensing evidence to evaluate, or should it stay reference-only?
- Which import layer is most convincing for a synthetic-data demo: CSV rules, OFX/QIF parsing, or a direct JSON/REST transaction API?
- Are the newer tax-engine candidates, especially Filed Open Tax Engine, mature enough to evaluate deeply, or should they be treated as promising but unproven?
- Is UsTaxes broad enough for a Week 2 hands-on test, or will state/schedule gaps make HabuTax/OpenTaxSolver better tax-form comparators?
- Should PolicyEngine US / Tax-Calculator stay in the shortlist conversation as model comparators despite not being consumer filing tools?
